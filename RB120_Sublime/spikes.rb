# ### Preschool (by Natalie Thompson)

# Inside a preschool there are children, teachers, class assistants, a principle, janitors, and cafeteria workers. 
# Both teachers and assistants can help a student with schoolwork and watch them on the playground. 
# A teacher teaches 
# and an assistant helps kids with any bathroom emergencies. 
# Kids themselves can learn and play. 
# A teacher and principle can supervise a class. 
# Only the principle has the ability to expel a kid. 
# Janitors have the ability to clean. 
# Cafeteria workers have the ability to serve food. 
# Children, teachers, class assistants, principles, janitors and cafeteria workers all have the ability to eat lunch.
